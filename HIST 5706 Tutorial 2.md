# what I was trying to do
_build a static website_

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

_This will be useful when I want to publish my work online_

![link to my site]([http://jonahe5.github.io/](http://jonahe5.github.io/))

## what I did

+ step 1 
+ made new repository
+ step 2
+ made a .md file
+ step 3
+ uploaded to github and set the settings

## challenges
_Had trouble with this line: ”Commit that file. Then, hit the gear wheel icon and scroll down to the Github Pages section. Enable Github Pages. Github will run your text files through the Jekyll site builder for you; here you can select from some of their templates.”_

_Found that edits made on GitHub take a few seconds before they update the page_

## thoughts on where to go next
_I found that I was liking the wrong gear wheel, then found that Github pages wasn’t working. To fix, I followed the instructions and changed the repository to public._

**copy this file to your github repository and rename it there ``log-file-for-tutorial-on-staticwebsites.md`**
